# LAF

This project provides a web-based implementation of the Label-Based Argumentation Framework (LAF) described in Budán, M. C. D. et al. — “An approach to characterize graded entailment of arguments through a label-based framework”

The system allows users to:

Define facts and rules forming a knowledge base
- Define label-dependent algebraic operations
- Automatically infer argumentative structures
- Construct an argumentation graph
- Expose the graph through a REST API for visualization and analysis

The repository contains:
- A Spring Boot backend (argumentation logic and inference)
- A frontend application (to be included) for interactive visualization
